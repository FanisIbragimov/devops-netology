2. Plan для воркспейса prod
```
Switched to workspace "prod".
root@ubuntu1:~/73# terraform plan
aws_s3_bucket.my-s3-bucket: Refreshing state... [id=my-s3bucket-20220107131444770200000001]
aws_instance.web[0]: Refreshing state... [id=i-06b3c6cb6fe783e64]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
